## Cusco: Where history meets adventure

Cusco, the ancient capital of the Inca Empire, is much more than a stop on the way to Machu Picchu. It‚Äôs a vibrant destination full of colonial architecture, colorful markets, and a unique energy that connects past and present.

### üèõÔ∏è Heritage and living culture

From the majestic Plaza de Armas to the Inca walls of Sacsayhuam√°n, every corner of Cusco tells a story. Museums, temples, and cobblestone streets offer an immersive experience for those seeking to understand Peru‚Äôs rich cultural heritage.

### üç≤ Local cuisine

You can‚Äôt leave without trying a delicious **aj√≠ de gallina**, **fresh trout from the Sacred Valley**, or **artisanal Cusco chocolate**. Many restaurants offer accessible options and adapted menus for all visitors.

### ‚ôø Accessible tourism

Cusco is making progress in inclusive infrastructure. At Accessible Travel Peru, we design adapted experiences for people with reduced mobility, including accessible transportation, trained guides, and certified accessible accommodations.

### üåÑ Must-see excursions

- **Sacred Valley**: Pisaq, Ollantaytambo, and Chinchero, with spectacular views and traditional markets.  
- **Machu Picchu**: Accessible via adapted train and personalized assistance.  
- **Rainbow Mountain**: Transportation and support options for those unable to complete the full hike.
